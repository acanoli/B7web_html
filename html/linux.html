    <h1> History of Linux</h1>
    <p>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.</p>
    <p>Linux was originally developed as a free operating system for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers and supercomputers. It is also used on embedded systems such as mobile phones (e.g., Android), tablets, network routers, televisions (e.g., Android TV), and video game consoles (e.g., Steam Deck).</p>
    <p>Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration               
. The underlying source code may be used, modified, and distributed—commercially or non-commercially—by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License.</p>
